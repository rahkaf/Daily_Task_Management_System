# 🚀 Daily Task Management System (DTMS)

DTMS is an **AI-driven enterprise-grade platform** designed for **freelance-based organizations**.  
It automates project management, task distribution, finance allocation, time tracking, and reporting with minimal human input.  

Humans only provide **project title, description, and client budget** — everything else is handled by AI.  

---

## ✨ Features
- 🤖 **AI-first automation** – smart task allocation & workload balancing  
- 📊 **Real-time dashboards** – track projects, tasks, and finances instantly  
- 💸 **Automated finance distribution** – role-based budget allocations  
- 📅 **Time tracking** – billable vs non-billable hours  
- 📑 **Client & document management** – secure storage with AI auto-tagging  
- 🔔 **Notifications** – in-app + email alerts for tasks and payments
